## Resources {#resources}

There are many, many excellent JavScript resources on the web. I strongly recommend the [MDN JavaScript Learning Pathway](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript). I also have a very high opinion of  [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), but in past years students have often found it somewhat difficult. However, it rewards careful study, teaches excellent habits, and encourages creative thinking while coding. Both MDN and _EJ_ have built-in JS Consoles forexperimenting with code (see below).

MDN also has a more advanced guide to JavaScript which starts with [this "reintroduction"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A%5Fre-introduction%5Fto%5FJavaScript). This can be worth consulting if you want more information.


## Consoles and Playgrounds {#consoles-and-playgrounds}

Sometimes you will want to try out your code and test out your ideas before putting them in a permanent file. There are various tools for this.

Browser consoles and scratchpads
: Your browser has a built-in "console" where you can enter javascript commands and see their output. See [the Setup doc](https://digitalhistory.github.io/tools/setup/#web-browser) for more info.

node console
: Unfortunately, VSCode does not have a built-in javascript console. However, you can easily create one in a terminal window by running the command `node`. Exit by typing `Control-d` or `Control-c Control-c` or `.exit`.

VSCode Debugger
: VSCode has an excellent debugger. However, debugging is a complicated subject. If you want to try to use these tools, [read the docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging).

VSCode extensions
: There are many excellent VSCode extensions for JavaScript. You can experiment with [quokka](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode), for instance.

Online Playgrounds
: These can be fantastic resources, but they make more sense for web-based programming. We may discuss these later in the course.
