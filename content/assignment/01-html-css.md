## General Description {#general-description}

You do not have to become a coder to do well in this course.  However, you _will_ have to be willing to explore technical skills that you might not otherwise develop as a humanities scholar.  In this second assignment, we'll use one of the web's many excellent self-education platforms to learn the very basics of how web pages work.  We'll then extend that knowledge with a set of slightly more advanced programming exercises.

Web pages are composed of three components:  HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  HTML provides the _structure and content_ of a web page; CSS controls the _style of presentation_; and Javascript permits _dynamic modification_ of both.  To explore the web from the inside, you need to be a little bit comfortable in all three.

In this assignment you will be introduced to HTML and CSS. First you will complete the HTML & CSS course on [Codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/).  Then you'll be asked to do a set of small problems and submit them via Github.
