Remember that the proper way to create your assignment repository [is by clicking on this lick, allowing Github Classroom to do the work for you](https://classroom.github.com/a/oC6%5F7PJk). (But you should already have done this for the last two assignments, and if you haven't this assignment is probably not for you!)

As before, please make sure you've pulled from the upstream repository before starting work on this assignment.  See your own repo or [the upstream Github Repo](https://github.com/DigitalHistory/advanced-topics/tree/master/project-proposal) for details.
