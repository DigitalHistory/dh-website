**Due Date: March 18**

Your next assignment builds directly from our in-class exercise, and should be quite a bit easier to manage, technically, than your last assignment.  Essentially, you will repeat the in-class assignment with much greater intellectual effort, but using the same technical framework. [The assignment is now online](https://classroom.github.com/a/oC6%5F7PJk), and I have extended the due date to Monday, March 18.
