**Due Date: March 29**

Rather than repeat myself in my usual error-prone way, I will remind you [that the proper way to create your assignment repository is by clicking on this lick, allowing Github Classroom to do the work for you](https://classroom.github.com/a/ag2mWqkY). (But you should already have done this for the last assignment!) Please also read the [assignment description on Github](https://github.com/DigitalHistory/advanced-topics/tree/master/oral-history). We will discuss this at greater length in class in the final weeks of the semester.
