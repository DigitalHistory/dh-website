**Due Date: October 25**

In this assignment, you will slowly work your way up to manipulation of real web pages via Javascript.  This can be a difficult transition, so be prepared for some teeth-gnashing.

Due at end of the day on the due date, you can [find the asssignment link on Github](https://classroom.github.com/a/QF4h7vfa), and please be sure to create your own copy and clone the resultant repository to your laptop. (Don't search out and fork the parent repository!)
