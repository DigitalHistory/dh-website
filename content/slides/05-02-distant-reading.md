## Recap {#recap-53d2}

-   "Public sphere" at a turning point
-   Transformation by automated agents and encoded text


### War is Peace. <br/>Freedom is Slavery. <br/>Ignorance is Strength. {#war-is-peace}


### Plan for the day {#plan-for-the-day-b6ce}

-   Problems of Abundance
-   Distant Reading: a method for textual overload?
-   Discussion: how do **you** respond to information abundance?
-   post-class period **ONLY** for students who **failed the tests, or did not receive a mark**


## History in the age of scarcity {#history-in-the-age-of-scarcity-3970}

> The members of prehistoric societies did not think they lived in prehistoric times. They merely lacked a good preservation medium. (Auerbach, quoted in Rosenzweig)

<div class="NOTES">
  <div></div>

-   lots was going on, lots of continuity, lots **we will never know** b/c oral preservation is **terrible** at outliving a cultural tradition

</div>


### Scarcity {#scarcity-184c}

-   Historically, very little recorded
-   Even less _preserved_
-   historian's task was to _locate rare sources_ in faraway places


### Implications {#implications-1db9}

-   History skewed to _those whose records appeared worth saving_
-   record _always_ fragmentary
    -   Historian free to fill in gaps
-   BUT: often possible to read _large percentage_ of relevant sources


## Age of Abundance {#age-of-abundance-7ddc}

> Tentative efforts are afoot to preserve our digital cultural heritage. If they succeed, historians will face a second, profound challenge&#x2013;what would it be like to write history when faced by an essentially complete historical record? (Rosenzweig)

<div class="NOTES">
  <div></div>

-   completely different situation than we used to have!

</div>


### Abundance {#abundance-6257}

-   **much** more recorded than in the past
-   **vastly more** preserved, at least for now
-   increasing percentage of historical works as well


### Mechanical Speech {#mechanical-speech-c3b6}

-   auto-preservation
-   but by and for whom?

<div class="NOTES">
  <div></div>

Google, FB, and Twitter are preserving lots of data.  As are Tesla and Samsung. But who will get to see it? How does a historian compete?

</div>


### Problems of Preservation {#problems-of-preservation-29ba}

-   physical media
-   software turnover & bitrot
-   capturing dynamic/interactive media

<div class="NOTES">
  <div></div>



</div>


### What big data means for old documents {#what-big-data-means-for-old-documents-608a}

> digitization does provide scale (or quantity) but does so at the price of rich, largely manual encoding. Visualization, customization, personalization, and similar analytical services increasingly familiar to us depend upon born-digital objects in which a great deal of structural and semantic knowledge has been encoded. The information captured on page images is, by contrast, implicit and often not directly accessible to the machines that will be always their first, often their only, and arguably their most important readers. (CILR)


### Can we tell stories? Can we do research? {#can-we-tell-stories?-can-we-do-research?-269a}

-   no longer possible to read everything!
    -   who will read it for us? How will we be experts? Can we automate our reading?
-   Narrative form ill-suited to massive quantities of data
    -   can we develop new types of narratives?
-   Big questions may be answerable!
    -   What used to be pure speculation, can perhaps now be made more concrete and compelling
        -   How does role of religion in public discourse change over time?
        -   how do railroads impact social and economic development?
        -   others?


## Abundance: Summary {#recap-77644}

-   "Abundance" offers many challenges
    -   preservation
    -   interpretation
    -   access
-   Does _history itself_ need to be reformed?
    -   What _relation to sources_?
    -   What _kinds of arguments_?
    -   What _narrative forms_?


## No Clothes, no body {#no-clothes-no-body}

> It’s not that the emperor has no clothes(that would be fine); it’s that no one knows what the emperor looks like. (Ramsey 2010)

<div class="NOTES">
  <div></div>

"It's one thing to worry that your canon isn't sufficiently inclusive, or broad, or representative. It's another thing when your canon has no better chance of being these thngs than a random selection. When we get up into the 14-million book range, books that are known by more than 2 living people are already "popular"

</div>


## Distant Reading: Abstract Models {#abstract-models-d7c3}

> &#x2026;distance is however not an obstacle, but a _specific form of knowledge:_ fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection. Shapes, relations, structures. Forms. Models.


### The opposite of close? {#the-opposite-of-close?-f387}

> Dorothea, endowed with the extraordinary capacity for attentiveness that is "ardor," is given to the strongest denunciations of the trivial, the most overwhelming anxieties of admitting the trivial into her life of any character in the novel. She is blind to the possibility that attention has the capacity to reveal that what seems trivial is in fact significant. She fears instead that the attention is wasted by devoting itself to those common objects which really are trivial, which have no redeeming significance:
>
> "&#x2026;I should learn everything then," she said to herself, still walking quickly along the bridle road through the wood. "It would be my duty to study that I might help him the better in his great works. There would be nothing trivial about our lives. Everyday-things with us would mean the greatest things."

<div class="NOTES">
  <div></div>

to notice:

-   analysis of passage longer than passage itself.

</div>


### To the point of deconstruction {#to-the-point-of-deconstruction-7de9}

> If the pharmakon is ambivalent, it is because it constitutes the medium in which opposites are opposed, the movement and the play that links them among themselves, reverses them or makes one side cross over into the other (soul/ body, good/ evil, inside/ outside, memory/ forgetfulness, speech/ writing, etc.). The pharmakon is the movement, the locus, and the play: (the production of) difference. It is the différance of difference. It holds in reserve, in its undecided shadow and vigil, the opposites and the differends that the process of discrimination will come to carve out. Contradictions and pairs of opposites are lifted from the bottom of this diacritical, differing, deferring, reserve. Already inhabited by différance, this reserve, even though it precedes the opposition between different effects, even though it preexists differences as effects, does not have the punctual simplicity of a coincidentia oppositorum. It is from this fund that dialectics draws its reserves.


### Closeness {#closeness-431d}

-   Literary study long organized around "close" reading
-   "Hermeneutic" model of scholarship
-   defines what it has meant to _understand_ or _master_ a text


### Questioning Close Reading {#questioning-close-reading-7c74}

-   But what is understanding?
-   what is literature?
-   what is the scholar's goal?

<div class="NOTES">
  <div></div>



</div>


### Some Numbers {#some-numbers-b757}

-   ~62,000 new Novels published in English in the US/year
-   ~304,000 new and re-issued _books_ in US/year
-   ~129,000,000 books collected in world's libraries

<!--listend-->

-   **not possible to read these**
    -   can one still be an expert?


### New forms of Understanding? {#new-forms-of-understanding?-c1c6}

-   instead of, or in parallel with, close reading?
-   apprehension of _large-scale phenomena_
-   studying models, rather than texts themselves


### Questions to consider {#questions-to-consider-6df4}

-   Does this count as _comprehension_?
-   what new skills are required?
-   What are the weaknesses of this form?


## Graphs {#graphs-70bf}

{{< figure src="https://seeingcomplexity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/william%5Fplayfair%5Fgraph.jpg" >}}

<div style="float:left;">
  <div></div>

-   _condense_ data
-   _conceptualize_ mathematically
-   _convince_ readers
-   a fundamentally **rhetorical** tool

</div>


### Moretti's Graphs {#moretti's-graphs-68bd}

{{< figure src="https://newleftreview-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/system/dragonfly/production/2019/05/13/3iz0atrlo0%5F2580502large.gif" >}}

> Quantitative research provides a type of data which is ideally independent of interpretations. (p.9)

-   yet, the graph is an argument:  rise, fall, rise


### A History of Readers {#a-history-of-readers-7e72}

{{< figure src="http://sandbox.hackinghistory.ca/assets/images/DH/three-rises-novel-colored.gif" >}}

-   each phase a new "kind" of reader
-   intensive, extensive, generic


### Cycles {#cycles-3686}

> Event, cycle, _longue durée_: three time frames which have fared very unevenly in literary studies.
>
> &#x2026; cycles constitute _temporary structures within the historical flow._ (p.14)

-   **event &rarr; close reading**
-   **longue durée &rarr; grand narrative**
-   **cycle &rarr; ?**


### Cycles in Literature {#cycles-in-literature-f456}

{{< figure src="http://sandbox.hackinghistory.ca/assets/images/DH/genres-colored.gif" >}}

> A genre exhausts its potentialities&#x2026; when its inner form is no longer capable of representing the most significant aspects of contemporary reality. (p. 17, fn 7)


### Genre & Generation {#genre-&-generation-5762}

> &#x2026; some kind of generational mechanism seems the best way to account for the regularity of the novelistic cycle&#x2026; (p. 22)

-   "Normal literature"
-   but "revolution" as "dying out"


### From "the shift" to "a shift" {#shift-4356}

{{< figure src="http://newleftreview.org/static/assets/images/2580512large.gif" >}}

> &#x2026;the point is not who prevails in this or that skirmish, but exactly the opposite: no victory is ever definitive&#x2026; the form keeps oscillating back and forth between the two groups. (p.29)


### Moretti's method {#moretti's-method-dbf4}

> &#x2026;the real point here&#x2026; is the total _heterogeneity of problem and solution:_ to make sense of quantitative data, I had to abandon the quantitative universe, and turn to morphology: evoke form, in order to explain figures.

-   how justified is this move?
-   what do we learn from it?


## Maps {#maps-59e4}

> There is a very simple question about literary maps: what exactly do they _do_?

-   like graphs, maps are a _persuasive tool_
-   What does it mean to "map" a novel?


### What is a map? {#what-is-a-map?-44e9}

{{< figure src="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/research/epp2/15.gif" >}}

{{< figure src="http://theexpertsagree.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/tokyorail.jpg" >}}

{{< figure src="http://www.fubiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/am1.jpg" >}}


### What is a map? {#what-is-a-map?-6c3d}

-   abstract
-   visual
-   representation
-   of a physical or imagined space


### Moretti's method {#moretti's-method-ddd7}

{{< figure src="http://www.newleftreview.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/assets/images/2600502large.gif" >}}

{{< figure src="http://www.newleftreview.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/assets/images/2600511large.gif" >}}

> The form of an object is a 'diagram of forces', in this sense, at least that from it we can&#x2026; deduce the forces that &#x2026; have acted upon it. (p.57)


### _Our Village_ {#/our-village/-c56c}

> In the 1824 volume&#x2026; the vilage was the undisputed centre of the surrounding countryside: the centripetal effects of the force "from within" were omnipresent, while the force "from without" was nowhere to be seen. (p. 57)
>
> Two collections later, in 1828, the village's gravitation field is already weaker&#x2026;  Something is wrong with the force from within, but as no counter-force challenges it yet, the basic pattern&#x2026; remains in place.  But by 1832&#x2026; the village's centripetal force is reduced to nothing, and the bulk of the book moves away&#x2026; (p. 58-59)


### _Our Village_ &#x2013; Extremes {#/our-village/----extremes-3f27}

{{< figure src="http://www.newleftreview.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/assets/images/2600502large.gif" >}}

{{< figure src="http://www.newleftreview.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/assets/images/2600512large.gif" >}}


### Modelling the text {#modelling-the-text-1363}

-   **reduce** text to the model
-   **presume** that sociological factors are determinative
-   **sustain** focus on form ("a quantitative history of literature is also a profoundly formalist one" -p.25, fn 14)
-   **interpret** model in light of theories


## Trees {#trees-66d5}

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Darwin%5FTree%5F1837.png" >}}

{{< figure src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4e/Darwins%5Ftree%5Fof%5Flife%5F1859.png" >}}


### Moretti's Evolutionism {#moretti's-evolutionism-251f}

-   Citations: Darwin, Feldman, Cavalli-Sforza
-   In his genealogy: Karl Marx; H. G. Wells; E. O. Wilson; all of evolutionary psychology


### Plots {#plots-525b}

{{< figure src="https://newleftreview-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/system/dragonfly/production/2019/05/13/1tvogaisyo%5F2620303large.gif" >}}


#### Clues as _evolved_ phenomenon {#clues-as-/evolved/-phenomenon-baf4}

-   Doyle as _canonical starting point_ for detective fiction
-   But has a context; how to describe?
-   note: _not_ a personal context!


### Styles {#styles-4fc2}

{{< figure src="https://nplusonemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/moretti-2.jpg" >}}


#### Free Indirect Style {#free-indirect-style-4a25}

> A peculiar mix of indirect and direct discourse, which draws the verbal tenses and pronouns from the former, and the tone and the order of the sentence from the latter:
>
> It was the abode of noise, disorder, and impropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it ought to be. She could not respect her parents, as she had hoped.


#### Why FIS? {#why-fis?-eefc}

-   appears to mark a major social transformation ("halfway btwn the social doxa and the individual voice, FIS is a good indicator of their changing balance of forces")
-   Moretti's goal: to _quantitatively_ (?) trace these forces

    > Take a form, follow it from space to space, and study the reasons for its transformations: the 'opportunistic, hence unpredictable' reasons of evolution.


### Problematics {#problematics-4d4e}

-   Teleological thinking?
-   dealing with the "twisted branching"?
-   is this really "quantitative"?
-   Does this qualify as "insight"?


## Summary: Moretti and History {#summary:-moretti-and-history-59c4}

-   **labor-intensive** quantification of sources
-   **glossing over** problems of quantification
-   **continued reliance** on expert opinion &#x2013; but how is that expertise to be cultivated?
