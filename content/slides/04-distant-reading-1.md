## Reminder {#recap-7764}

-   "Abundance" offers many challenges
    -   preservation
    -   interpretation
    -   access
-   Does _history itself_ need to be reformed?
    -   What _relation to sources_?
    -   What _kinds of arguments_?
    -   What _narrative forms_?
-   missed the "openness" section


### Plan for the day {#plan-for-the-day-c53a}

-   Lecture (short as i can manage, will stop early if nec)
-   Class Discussion (what did you learn/ what do you doubt)
-   help w/ HTML/CSS/JS (if you're stuck/don't understand)


## Abstract Models {#abstract-models-d7c3}

> ...distance is however not an obstacle, but a _specific form of knowledge:_ fewer elements, hence a sharper sense of their overall interconnection. Shapes, relations, structures. Forms. Models.


### The opposite of close? {#the-opposite-of-close?-f387}

> Dorothea, endowed with the extraordinary capacity for attentiveness that is “ardor,” is given to the strongest denunciations of the trivial, the most overwhelming anxieties of admitting the trivial into her life of any character in the novel. She is blind to the possibility that attention has the capacity to reveal that what seems trivial is in fact significant. She fears instead that the attention is wasted by devoting itself to those common objects which really are trivial, which have no redeeming significance:
>
> "“I should learn everything then,” she said to herself, still walking quickly along the bridle road through the wood. “It would be my duty to study that I might help him the better in his great works. There would be nothing trivial about our lives. Everyday-things with us would mean the greatest things."

to notice:

-   analysis of passage longer than passage itself.

### To the point of deconstruction {#to-the-point-of-deconstruction-7de9}

> If the pharmakon is ‘ambivalent,’ it is because it constitutes the medium in which opposites are opposed, the movement and the play that links them among themselves, reverses them or makes one side cross over into the other (soul/ body, good/ evil, inside/ outside, memory/ forgetfulness, speech/ writing, etc.).…The pharmakon is the movement, the locus, and the play: (the production of) difference. It is the différance of difference. It holds in reserve, in its undecided shadow and vigil, the opposites and the differends that the process of discrimination will come to carve out. Contradictions and pairs of opposites are lifted from the bottom of this diacritical, differing, deferring, reserve. Already inhabited by différance, this reserve, even though it ‘precedes’ the opposition between different effects, even though it preexists differences as effects, does not have the punctual simplicity of a coincidentia oppositorum. It is from this fund that dialectics draws its reserves.


### Closeness {#closeness-431d}

-   Literary study long organized around "close" reading
-   "Hermeneutic" model of scholarship
-   defines what it has meant to _understand_ or _master_ a text


### Questioning Close Reading {#questioning-close-reading-7c74}

-   But what is understanding?
-   what is literature?
-   what is the scholar's goal?

<div class="NOTES">
  <div></div>



</div>


### Some Numbers {#some-numbers-b757}

-   ~62,000 new Novels published in English in the US/year
-   ~304,000 new and re-issued _books_ in US/year
-   ~129,000,000 books collected in world's libraries

<!--listend-->

-   **not possible to read these**
    -   can one still be an expert?


### New forms of Understanding? {#new-forms-of-understanding?-c1c6}

-   instead of, or in parallel with, close reading?
-   apprehension of _large-scale phenomena_
-   studying models, rather than texts themselves


### Questions to consider {#questions-to-consider-6df4}

-   Does this count as _comprehension_?
-   what new skills are required?
-   What are the weaknesses of this form?


## Graphs {#graphs-70bf}

{{< figure src="https://seeingcomplexity.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/william%5Fplayfair%5Fgraph.jpg" >}}

<div style="float:left;">
  <div></div>

-   _condense_ data
-   _conceptualize_ mathematically
-   _convince_ readers
-   a fundamentally **rhetorical** tool

</div>


### Moretti's Graphs {#moretti's-graphs-68bd}

{{< figure src="http://newleftreview.org/static/assets/images/2580501large.gif" >}}

> Quantitative research provides a type of data which is ideally independent of interpretations. (p.9)

-   yet, the graph is an argument:  rise, fall, rise


### A History of Readers {#a-history-of-readers-7e72}

{{< figure src="http://sandbox.hackinghistory.ca/assets/images/DH/three-rises-novel-colored.gif" >}}

-   each phase a new "kind" of reader
-   intensive, extensive, generic


### Cycles {#cycles-3686}

> Event, cycle, _longue durée_: three time frames which have fared very unevenly in literary studies.
>
> ... cycles constitute _temporary structures within the historical flow._ (p.14)

-   **event &rarr; close reading**
-   **longue durée &rarr; grand narrative**
-   **cycle &rarr; ?**


### Cycles in Literature {#cycles-in-literature-f456}

{{< figure src="http://sandbox.hackinghistory.ca/assets/images/DH/genres-colored.gif" >}}

> A genre exhausts its potentialities... when its inner form is no longer capable of representing the most significant aspects of contemporary reality. (p. 17, fn 7)


### Genre & Generation {#genre-&-generation-5762}

> ... some kind of generational mechanism seems the best way to account for the regularity of the novelistic cycle... (p. 22)

-   "Normal literature"
-   but "revolution" as "dying out"


### From "the shift" to "a shift" {#shift-4356}

{{< figure src="http://newleftreview.org/static/assets/images/2580512large.gif" >}}

> ...the point is not who prevails in this or that skirmish, but exactly the opposite: no victory is ever definitive... the form keeps oscillating back and forth between the two groups. (p.29)


### Moretti's method {#moretti's-method-dbf4}

> ...the real point here... is the total _heterogeneity of problem and solution:_ to make sense of quantitative data, I had to abandon the quantitative universe, and turn to morphology: evoke form, in order to explain figures.

-   how justified is this move?
-   what do we learn from it?


## Maps {#maps-59e4}

> There is a very simple question about literary maps: what exactly do they _do_?

-   like graphs, maps are a _persuasive tool_
-   What does it mean to "map" a novel?


### What is a map? {#what-is-a-map?-44e9}

{{< figure src="http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/research/epp2/15.gif" >}}

{{< figure src="http://theexpertsagree.files.wordpress.com/2009/06/tokyorail.jpg" >}}

{{< figure src="http://www.fubiz.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/am1.jpg" >}}


### What is a map? {#what-is-a-map?-6c3d}

-   abstract
-   visual
-   representation
-   of a physical or imagined space


### Moretti's method {#moretti's-method-ddd7}

{{< figure src="http://www.newleftreview.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/assets/images/2600502large.gif" >}}

{{< figure src="http://www.newleftreview.org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/assets/images/2600511large.gif" >}}

> The form of an object is a 'diagram of forces', in this sense, at least that from it we can... deduce the forces that ... have acted upon it. (p.57)


### _Our Village_ {#/our-village/-c56c}

> In the 1824 volume... the vilage was the undisputed centre of the surrounding countryside: the centripetal effects of the force "from within" were omnipresent, while the force "from without" was nowhere to be seen. (p. 57)
>
> Two collections later, in 1828, the village's gravitation field is already weaker...  Something is wrong with the force from within, but as no counter-force challenges it yet, the basic pattern... remains in place.  But by 1832... the village's centripetal force is reduced to nothing, and the bulk of the book moves away... (p. 58-59)


### _Our Village_ -- Extremes {#/our-village/----extremes-3f27}

### Modelling the text {#modelling-the-text-1363}

-   **reduce** text to the model
-   **presume** that sociological factors are determinative
-   **sustain** focus on form ("a quantitative history of literature is also a profoundly formalist one" -p.25, fn 14)
-   **interpret** model in light of theories


## Summary: Moretti and History {#summary:-moretti-and-history-59c4}

-   **labor-intensive** quantification of sources
-   **glossing over** problems of quantification
-   **continued reliance** on expert opinion -- but how is that expertise to be cultivated?
