## Why Care about History? Why care about the Digital Age? {#why-care-about-history?-why-care-about-the-digital-age?-8917}


### The World Out of Which We Come {#the-world-out-of-which-we-come-eff1}

> The past is the world out of which we have come, the multitude of events and experiences that have shaped our conscious selves and the social worlds we inhabit. To understand how and why we live as we do, we cannot avoid appealing to the past to explain how andwhy we got to be this way. (Cronon 2000, p. 4)


### Not just Fact but Story {#not-just-fact-but-story-de42}

> It is remembering and storytelling we care about, not the raw past, because only by being perennially resurrected in the mind of each ne generation does the past become meaningful.  Only this does it become a living memory which in turn gives meaning to our present lives by reminding us ho we are--as individuals, as a state and nation, as a people. (_Ibid._, p. 13)


### A Digital Age {#a-digital-age-5662}

Opportunity:

-   masses of data
-   tremendous participation

Challenge

-   filtering data
-   trusting writers
-   lack of collective experience

-   what can we preserve?
-   what opportunities are there for change?
-   what has been done already?


## Method {#method-f5b6}

-   Intro to toolbox
-   but tools keep changing
-   therefore: **simple** coding, **basic** tools, as a foundation for later learning


## Syllabus {#syllabus-3974}

-   still uncharted territory (no canon, quite)
-   4 blocks
    -   Text & Code | Basic programming _literacy_
    -   Data Driven History | "Distant Reading"
    -   Maps & Visualization | Basic Web-based GIS
    -   Oral History & Crowdsourcing | Multi-media History


### Objectives {#objectives-4b0a}

At the end of this course, you should:

-   be able to describe to others what the phrase "digital humanities" means to you.
-   be able to frame a coherent and nuanced argument _of your own_ about the value of DH methods to the field of history
-   be able to clearly state and defend a position regarding "engaged scholarship", and articulate the relationship of your argument to the contemporary media landscape
-   have a basic understanding of markup languages and their use in DH
-   be able to make compelling use of media materials such as audio, video, and animation in historical arguments
-   understand how to create simple historical maps, and have an opinion about the value of GIS in historical argument
