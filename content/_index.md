# Digital History

This is the website for His 393, _Digital History_, at the University of Toronto. All of the course materials are described in detail in the links on the sidebar; you probably want to [start with the syllabus](./syllabus/his393syllabus/). Tables of contents for long pages can be access via the odd list icon at the top left of the page menu.
