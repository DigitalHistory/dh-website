In general, online communication should take place **via Slack**.  In the case of questions having to do with official University business (requests for extensions, discussion of accommodations, any message involving sensitive personal data) please [use my University email, being sure to put "HIS393" in the subject line](mailto:matt.price@utoronto.ca?subject=HIS389%20Digital%20History).


## Introduction {#introduction}

We all know &#x2013; it is so commonplace that we barely even notice it! &#x2013; that we are living through a revolutionary period in the history of communication.  In the year of your birth, the World Wide Web was a scrawny, hand-powered frontier of hand-coded sites and Internet startups.  Amazon and Google were infants.  The University of Toronto Library website [looked something like this](https://web.archive.org/web/19971210222202/http://library.utoronto.ca/):

{{< figure src="/ox-hugo/Screenshot from 2015-06-23 16-12-51.png" class="someclass" >}}

and many students and faculty still used the card catalog to find books in Robarts.

Today, the processes of research, writing and reading are all dramatically transformed by information technology.  Instead of painstakingly discovering rare books and manuscript artifacts, we can do full-text searches on a vast corpus.  Our writing is mediated by immensely powerful computing machines, and our creations need not be limited exclusively to the linear texts around which all the humanities initially took shape.  Readers encounter our writing, not as a few precious drops of information in a desert of ignorance, but as part of an endless stream of information that assaults them all day long.

How should history respond to these new conditions of our existence?  In this class we explore foundational topics in the "[digital](http://whatisdigitalhumanities.com/) [humanities](http://digital.humanities.ox.ac.uk/Support/whatarethedh.aspx)" and ask what we can learn from them about _how we should be doing history_ &#x2013; in particular, how we should be collecting, analyzing, synthesizing and presenting knowledge.

-   How do the digital media developed in the last two decades change the way we understand history? Can the fundamental goal of _interpreting_ the past survive?
-   What, if any, new technical skills do we need to acquire?
-   Can we use the new media to ask (and answer!) new kinds of questions? Can they help us improve our answers to the old questions?
-   Perhaps most powerfully: how do the new digital conditions of existence relate to the question of "engaged" scholarship?  What new opportunities, constraints, and dangers does digital production call forth when we mix scholarship and citizenship?


## Objectives {#objectives}

At the end of this course, you should:

-   be able to describe to others what the phrase "digital humanities" means to you.
-   be able to frame a coherent and nuanced argument _of your own_ about the value of DH methods to the field of history
-   be able to clearly state and defend a position regarding "engaged scholarship", and articulate the relationship of your argument to the contemporary media landscape
-   have a basic understanding of markup languages and their use in DH
-   be able to make compelling use of media materials such as audio, video, and animation in historical arguments
-   understand how to create simple historical maps, and have an opinion about the value of GIS in historical argument


## Method {#method}

There are many approaches to the digital humanities, all of them involving tools that are under rapid and iterative development.  A given project is likely to require a substantial training period in the particular tools chosen by the principal investigators.  It is therefore not possible for this course to provide an effective survey of "the" digital humanities toolkit. But learning  tools is an essential skill for the digital humanist. So what should we do?

Almost every digital humanist will, at some point, need to do the following:

-   read and edit HTML, CSS and Javascript
-   debug running web pages using the browser's built-in tools
-   use a text editor to write code in any of several languages
-   collaborate with peers using version control software, almost always `git`

Our emphasis is therefore on _simple coding_ taught using _standard tools that are available almost everywhere_.  Almost all of the software we use is Free or Open Source. You will learn very basic web development skills and _slowly_ come to apply them to _increasingly sophisticated_ (but still pretty simple!) historical questions.  These baby steps will give you some sense of what skills a "real" digital history project requires, and give you the tools you'll need to _teach yourself_ when you encounter new tools in the course of a project.


## Policies {#policies}


### Accessibility {#accessibility}

The University provides academic accommodations for students with disabilities in accordance with the terms of the Ontario Human Rights Code. For information on services and resources, see <http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as>


### Respecting Diversity {#respecting-diversity}

Diverse backgrounds, embodiments, and experiences are essential to the critical thinking endeavor at the heart of higher education. We expect you to be respectful of the many social and cultural differences among us, which may include, but are not limited to: age, cultural background, disability, ethnicity, technical ability, gender identity and presentation, citizenship and immigration status, national origin, race, religious and political beliefs, sex, sexual orientation, and socioeconomic status. Please talk with me right away if you experience disrespect in this class—from any source, including myself—and I will active work to address it.


### Correspondence {#correspondence}

As noted above, most communication should take place **via Slack**.  In the case of questions having to do with official University business (requests for extensions, discussion of accommodations, any message involving sensitive personal data) please [use my University email, being sure to put "HIS393" in the subject line](mailto:matt.price@utoronto.ca?subject=HIS389%20Digital%20History).  I'll do my best to reply within two working days, though occasionally the delay may be slightly longer. Please allow the full 48 hours to elapse before sending a repeat email.

**Also:** I have an injury-related difficulty co-ordinating action between my left and right hands, which leads to very frequent & distinctive typographical errors (and is also one of the many reasons you don't want to hear me play a musical instrument). In my course materials, assignment comments, and announcements, I strive to eliminate those errors, but in instant messaging I am less attentive, as typing corrections approximately triples my composition time. So&#x2026; please bear with me.


### Attendance {#attendance}

Make every effort to attend each class meeting (including lab sections)! Class will begin and (usually) end on time. Please do your best to get to class before the start of the session. Students are expected to attend all meetings, with exceptions permitted in case of illness and family emergencies.

Please silence all cell phones/pagers/etc. before the beginning of each class. You should bring your laptop for in-class work, but please don't use class time (lecture or lab) to check your email, update your Facebook, read reddit, watch YouTube, make dank memes, seize the means of production (well, that may be allowed under certain circumstances), etc. Such usage is distracting and interferes with learning both for you and for all the other students around you. If I notice you doing this, I will call you out in public. Spend class time on class materials. If another student's activity is distracting, please ask them to stop it (or let me know outside of class).


## Tools {#tools}

Course assignments will require you to install software. All of the software we use is free, but it **requires a laptop to run**. A Chromebook unfortunately will not be sufficient. While it is in principle possible to do all of your assignments on the web or using a very basic text editor, I do not recommend that method, and will not offer technical support.  If you don't own a laptop, you should find a way to borrow one, or buy a cheap model on College St to use for the duration of the semester.

I can offer help with the following

## Course Requirements & Grading {#course-requirements-and-grading}

The assignments in this course take a wide variety of forms, and for the most part, differ significantly from what you're likely to have encountered in other History courses. If you have little technical experience, or have perhaps ended up in this course by accident (!), you may find some of the work daunting at first. I have done my very best to make the assignments feasible for beginners, but you will likely encounter some difficult moments.  I therefore **strongly** urge you to (1) start early! and (2) persevere through the difficult initial stages.  The frustration you experience is, in fact, part of pedagogical method here.  You are not expected to become a coding ninja, but _learning how to learn_ is a major component of work in the Digital Humanities.

Be warned! Marking in this course is unusual!

Grading in this course is done using a _modified point system_. The system may seem odd at first, but it has definite advantages for both students and teachers, so don't be intimidated. Instead of receiving a number or letter grade for each assignment, and then getting a weighted sum of those grades as your final mark, you will _choose what final mark to try for_ and then _complete the assignments required for that mark_.  A certain set of assignments is required for a D; for a C, you must complete all of the "D" assignments plus another set; for a B, all of the C assignments plus some more; and the same goes for an A.

Here are some more details:

All Assignments Are Graded Pass/Fail
: Each assignment you get will include a careful explanation of my expectations. If your work meets those expectations, you get full credit; if not you get _no credit_.

A 'Passing' Mark on Assignments is a B+
: In order to get credit for an assignment, you will have to demonstrate a high level of mastery &#x2013; about the level normally required for a B+.

Each Higher Grade Represents a quantum level of additional achievement
: As you move up the ladder, assignments test more advanced and difficult concepts from the course.

If you fail, you can try again
: You start the semester with 5 'retry' chits, which you can use to resubmit assignments that have not succeeded. If necessary, you can use all of those chits on a single assignment! Resubmission process must be completed withing 1 week of the return date of the original version.

A late assignment costs one 'retry' chit
: There is no percentage penalty for late work; instead, a late paper will cost you one of your retry opportunities.

Second and third tries get fewer comments
: I will give substantial comments on first tries; additional tries will get less and less fulsome commentary.

Pluses and Minuses are determined by participation
: The only part of your grade which is not determined on a pass/fail basis is the "+" or "-" part, which is assigned based on your on and offline participation.  See the participation grade sheet for more details.

I know there will be questions!  Please don't hesitate to ask them.  And here, finally, is the list of assignments. Detailed assignments will be handed out with adequate time to permit completion.

#### What the Web Signifies (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">Sep. 12</span></span>) {#what-the-web-signifies}

We all live with the web, but that doesn't mean we think much about _how it works_ and _what it's changed_. This week's lecture presents some thoughts on the changing nature of the public sphere and the significance of the web's _digital_ and _machine-readable_ nature.

**Readings:**

-   Juergen Habermas, "[The Public Sphere: An Encyclopedia Article](https://unige.ch/sciences-societe/socio/files/2914/0533/6073/Habermas%5F1974.pdf)" (1964)

**Resources:**
These Mozilla Developer Network guides are inter-related, and the structure is easy to get lost in. Still, this is among the best resources on the web.

-   [MDN: HTML Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting%5Fstarted%5Fwith%5Fthe%5Fweb/HTML%5Fbasics). Start here.
-   [MDN: Getting Started with the Web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting%5Fstarted%5Fwith%5Fthe%5Fweb) (HTML Basics, above, is part of this progression. You can skip this for now, but we'll come back to several of these topics later.)
-   [MDN: Intro to HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction%5Fto%5FHTML). This is a great, systematic introduction to the most important HTML elements. There are some interactive  exercises, and you can also copy code into files to experiment with in VSCode using the [Live Server Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=negokaz.live-server-preview) functionality.
-   [MDN: Learn  HTML Pathway](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML#Modules) . There's a ton more here; we will use some of it later on.
-   [MDN Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference). Complete reference for all HTML elements, These pages are often very technical, but can be useful when you find yourself stumped

#### Abundance and Openness (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">Sep. 19</span></span>) {#abundance-and-openness}

One of the key features of the web is its _immenseness_. We will discuss how this genuinely new circumstance transforms the work of the historian.

### Data Driven History {#data-driven-history}


#### Distant Reading 1 (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">Sep. 26</span></span>) {#distant-reading-1}

Franco Moretti's _Graphs, Maps, Trees_ was a manifesto of sorts for a data-driven literary history. We'll discuss the first 2/3s of this book before turning to some practical skills

**Readings:**

#### Text as Data, History as Algorithm (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">Oct. 10</span></span>) {#text-as-data-history-as-algorithm}

**Note:** we may need to push this up
We'll explore "topic modelling" &#x2013; one of the most popular DH methods &#x2013; as well as some critiques of it, and some more playful extrapolations about the future of data-driven history.

### Maps, Visualization, and History {#maps-visualization-and-history}


#### Spatial History (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">Oct. 24</span></span>) {#spatial-history}

Contemporary "Historical GIS" and web-based geohistory projects descend from an illustrious lineage of qualitative and quantitative "spatial histories". In class today we explore what happens when "place" takes centre stage in a historical analysis.

#### Maps Online (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">Oct. 31</span></span>) {#maps-online}

Maps and visiaulizations are neat and all, but contemporary web-based geohistory allows historical maps to interact powerfully with other data sources.  We'll explore some possibilities!

#### Visualization (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">Nov. 14</span></span>) {#visualization}

Of course, maps and graphs are in a certain sense part of a much broader field of _rhetorical visualizations:_ attempts to convey quantitative information through pictures in an effort to convince the reader.

#### Oral History & Remix Culture (<span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">Dec. 03</span></span>) {#oral-history-and-remix-culture}

Once oral histories migrate to the web, they, like maps, can interact with other kinds of data.

If we're ahead of schedule, we'll watch _Harlan County USA_ in class.
